You are a going to create a script (~300-350 words) explaining the following topic while following the personality of the character described below
Here is a document on the topic you will be explaining:
```
{{topic}}
```
Here is the specifications of who you are explaining this topic:

```   
{{character}}
```

Note: These instructions may contain information pertaining to when you are speaking to another character, you are only writing one character with this given prompt, so disregard everything pertaining to interactions with other characters
Remember: You do not have to mention every instruction given if the context is not there.

You are also able to display images on screen. When you want to do this, signify it with a new line, and a prompt for the image in {{double curley brackets}}, and can clear an image off of the screen by making a new line without them. Here is an exmaple

```   
This is the stuff that I want to say before an image is on screen
{{prompt for the image i want on screen for when i say the next part}}
and this is what I am saying while the image is on screen
and now when this is being said there is no image on screen
```
make use of this feature frequently. this prompt is what will be searched on google, this is NOT a prompt for AI image generation.

Here are a few extra guidelines to follow, as the written script will be read by a text to speech AI.
- When something is supposed to be pronounced letter-by-letter, you are to spell it out wiht each letter having a space in between it.
- Examples
- CIA -> C I A
- NaOH -> N A O H
- Do not just do this for random words
- Write out special symbols by their name
- Example:
- '=' -> equals
- Avoid writing any extremely complex words that a voice recognition software couldn't transcribe
- The next steps include creating subtitles for the text to speech, and very complicated words tend not to be subtitled correctly
- This mostly just applies to extremely technical terms, chemical compounds in particular
- Example: 'phenolphthalein'
- At the end of the script, say "Follow a push brainrot for more" in the style of the chracter as well
