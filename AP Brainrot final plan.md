## Script Generation
- Will be moving to openAI, need to test 4o-Mini to see if it is worth it
    - Current test says the average APUSH ID is ~780 Tokens if stripped of excess characters
    - This would cost 0.40$ For 1282 Apush ID(there are only ~300 of them)
    - Reponse scripts are ~450 Tokens
    - We can Generate 300 ID scripts for 0.32$
- set base prompt on how to respond to everything ✅
- input .md from obsidian notes✅
    - MUST DO: Basic text tranforming script to remove waste tokens
- character specifics✅
- Seperate base prompt for conversations

## Conversation workflow
- Chracter not speaking will need to pause
- Will require interruptions for the bits that certain characters will have
    - Lebron forgetting the constant of integration: "Come on man"
    - Invincible question -> "let me break it down for you mark" -> bacon egg and cheese
        - Also him just goign uh-huh
    - Hey mater were you there -> 1000 yard stare

# Plan for videos
- AP Chem: Dr Pickle and Breaking bad
    - Do not start until latex is functioning, or if we can figure out image searching
    - Jesse and Walt conversation
- Calc: Any Characters, but use lebron on many conversations
    - Don't do unti Manim is feasible
    - Likely want conversational ones
- APUSH: Bidenator, Trump. McQueen and Mater
    - Trump solo speechs
        - ID Words
    - AI Presidents on others
        - Probably on broader scope
    - Hey mater, you were there when
        - needs further development for the bit
- AP Gov: Trump, Mark and Omni man
    - Basically the same as APUSH broader scope conversations
    - Need to get the "let me break it down for you mark" bit functioning
