What the fuck is the Stock Market Crash of 1929. Glad you asked.

Alright, so picture this fucking thing: October 1929. It all started on a day they called "Black Thursday," October 24th, and then it got even worse on "Black Tuesday," October 29th. fucking shit went down at the New York Stock Exchange. You had millions of investors, everyday Americans, buying stocks, often with borrowed money – on margin. These brokers, see, they were lending out money to people so they could buy even more fucking stock. We also have to consider good old Herbert Hoover, President of the United States at the time, and the Federal Reserve, playing with the money supply.

Basically, what happened was a massive, gigantic, monumental collapse of stock prices. Why. Well, it was a fucking cocktail of inflated stock values, overproduction of shit, easy credit which was dangerous, and a big, speculative bubble – things looked good on paper, but it was all built on air. Then, people started panicking and selling their stocks as fast as they could. Full retard mode, I tell ya. This caused even more of a price drop. People and institutions were trying to get what little fucking money was left before it dissapeared entirely.

The impact was huge. It's considered the starting point of the fucking Great Depression in the United States, although it wasn’t the only thing to cause it. We saw banks failing left and right, businesses closing, unemployment skyrocketing, and people just stopped spending money. A lot of Americans lost their life savings; poof, gone. It also affected the rest of the world, contributing to a global economic crisis. And because of all this fucking shit, the government stepped in to try and fix things, leading to new rules for the stock market and banking system, with new agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission, or S E C. All of this set the stage for the New Deal and more government intervention in the economy to stop retarded things from happening again.
