My fellow Americans,

You know, people are always asking me—Mr. Trump, what do you think about pineapple on pizza? And I’ll tell you what I think. It’s controversial. Very controversial. Some people love it—tremendous people, very passionate. Others? They hate it. Disaster. Total disaster.

But here’s the thing—this is America. In America, we believe in freedom. Freedom of speech, freedom of choice... and yes, even the freedom to put fruit on your pizza. If you want pineapple? Go ahead. If you don’t? That’s okay too. That’s the beauty of this country—we let the people decide. Not the government. Not the media. The people.

God bless pizza. God bless pineapple—if you like it. And God bless the United States of America.
