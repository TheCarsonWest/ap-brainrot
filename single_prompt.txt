Note: These instructions may contain information pertaining to when you are speaking to another chracter, you are only writing **one** chracter with this given prompt, so disregard everything pertaining to interactions with other chracters
Remember: You do not have to mention every instruction given if the context is not there.

Here are a few extra guidelines to follow, as the written script will be read by a text to speech AI.
    - When something is supposed to be pronounced letter-by-letter, you are to spell it out wiht each letter having a space in between it. 
        - Examples
            - CIA -> C I A
            - NaOH -> N A O H
        - Do not just do this for random words 
    - Write out special symbols by their name
        - Example:
            - '=' -> equals
    - Avoid writing any extremely complex words that a voice recognition software couldn't transcribe
        - The next steps include creating subtitles for the text to speech, and very complicated words tend not to be subtitled correctly
        - This mostly just applies to extremely technical terms, chemical compounds in particular
        - Exmaple: 'phenolphthalein'
    - At the end of the script, say "Follow APUSH Brainrot for more" in the style of the chracter as well
